# Tutorial-Level

Made initial push to create project.

Implemented simple 2D movement

Camera is always centered around player.

To be added:
Sprites, but CJ said he can handle that.
Animals (horses, pigs, cows)
Collision boxes for player and interactable objects
Regular obstacles like fences and rocks
Interactivity with objects, break rocks, 'leap' over chasms, open chests
Upgradable items
Sound effects and sound wave animation to show direction to head to find animals
